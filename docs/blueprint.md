# **App Name**: CementPlantAI

## Core Features:

- Data Simulation: Simulate real-time sensor data using historical data from a public dataset.
- Real-time Monitoring: Display real-time sensor readings on a dashboard.
- Historical Data Storage: Store validated sensor data in BigQuery for historical analysis.
- Anomaly Detection: Detect anomalies in sensor data and publish alerts.
- AI-Powered Optimization: Generate recommendations for optimizing cement production using the Gemini Pro API, by acting as a tool providing JSON for feed rates and fuel mix ratios.
- Natural Language Query: Enable users to query cement plant data using natural language, translated into SQL queries via Gemini Pro API.
- Alert Management: Display and manage alerts generated from anomaly detection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) to convey trust and technological prowess.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9FAFB), very desaturated to ensure clear presentation of data.
- Accent color: Teal (#2DD4BF) for highlighting key metrics and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for a modern, neutral look, readable in both headings and body text.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different sensor types and alerts.
- Use a grid-based layout to organize the dashboard and ensure a responsive design.
- Subtle animations when data updates to provide a dynamic user experience.
